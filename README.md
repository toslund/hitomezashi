# Hitomezashi Message Maker

 Hitomezashi is a form of [Japanese embroidery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sashiko) that uses a grid pattern. This tool lets you create those patterns based on an ASCII string. The result is a beautiful design that literally has a meaning becaues it is actually a decodable representation of your message.
